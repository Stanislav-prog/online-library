1. Add filtering for each column.
2. Complete all logic tasks for filtering:
    * for string fields: only those rows of the table which values coincides with the symbols printed in the filtering input fields.
    * for cost of the book: filtering should be in range from 1 to 1000; all books with corresponding cost should be filtered.
